# nixos-dev

nixos-dev is a virtual machine I created in proxmox to setup a development environment to work on NixOS configuration files for other NixOS machines.

Eventually, this vm will be re-defined in a more general way.

There is no default configuration here as it was manually created rather than being a general template.
